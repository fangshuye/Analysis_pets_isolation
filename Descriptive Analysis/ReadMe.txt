This code finished the data checking part of our analysis.

In detail, it did the following things:
4. Plot the demographic information(age,gender,ethnic,ed,income, married,hhsize, children, religion, psychproblem, genhealth) of the people who completed the survey once versus people who completed it twice.

Notes:

3. Since we only check the data consistent in 'age' and 'gender' for those who completed the survey twice, there exist differences between other demographic information. When I plot the distribution for them , I used the demographic data from wave1. This can be discussed if inappropriate.
