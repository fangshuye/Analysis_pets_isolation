- Data checking
  - remove anyone that did not answer Q66 correctly in either wave
  - remove  anyone who doesn’t have the same demographic information for “AGE” and “Gender” on wave 1 (2020-4-21) and wave 2 (5-4-2020). 
  - compare the demographic information of the people who completed the survey once versus people who completed it twice



05-19-2020

- Summary data checking and email everyone
- start the second part: **Pet owners versus no-pet owners.**



05-20-2020

- skip to the third part: **Cat owners versus dogs owners**



05-21-2020 (meeting log)

- (Done) delete the outlier of age
- (Done)  Covariates: **remove all covariates**
- (Done) **Include** volunteers who completed **once** and compare the results of 'include' and 'didn't include'.
- (Done) Add **random effect (people)** in my third model.
- (Done) For ordered variables like CCAS1-13: do a **rank-based test** (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Fridman test) and then we'll come up with an attachment score and do regression analysis.
- (Done) re-order the x-axis of the income plot.
- (Done)  Write a document to illustrate every step when we drop observations and why.
- (Done) Give a summary table(Mostattach, NotVet...) of 'Unique question for wave2' to select the variables we're gone to analyze.
- (Done) Always remember to give datasize.

- 3rd data came
- Same for pet owners versus non-pet owners; dogs owners versus cat owners
